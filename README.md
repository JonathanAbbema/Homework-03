My application uses a series of prompts for the user to select what types of characters they want to utilize in their randomly generated password. 
The application identifies the the information given by the user and stores it in different variables for the application to identify and generate in the password. 
After all inputs have been recorded by the user, a randomly generated password is created containing all user input.
